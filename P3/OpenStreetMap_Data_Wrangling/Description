Birmingham:
Birmingham is a major city in England’s West Midlands region, with multiple
Industrial Revolution-era landmarks that speak to its 18th-century history as a
manufacturing powerhouse. It’s also home to a network of canals, many of which
radiate from Sherborne Wharf and are now lined with trendy cafes and bars.

Reason:
I don't have any particular reason to choose Birmingham. I was searching for the
map on the Mapzen website. Birmingham just came to my sight. I have an urge to
know about new cities and hence to work with the Birmingham map data so that
when I finish the project I would have something about the city. I did learned
about how house numbers work in the city, in Britain.
